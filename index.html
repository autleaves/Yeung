                Implementing abstract data types. We implement ADTs with a Java class, putting the code in a
                file with the same name as the class, followed by the .java extension. The first statements in
                the file declare instance variables that define the data-type values. Following the instance
                variables are the constructor and the instance methods that implement operations on data-type
                values.
                Instance variables. To define data-type values (the state of each object), we declare instance
                variables in much the same way as we declare local variables. There are numerous values
                corresponding to each instance variable (one for each object that is an instance of the data
                type). Each declaration is qualified by a visibility modifier. In ADT implementations, we use
                private, using a Java language mechanism to enforce the idea that the representation of an ADT
                is to be hidden from the client, and also final, if the value is not to be changed once it is
                initialized.
                Constructors. The constructor establishes an object's identity and initializes the instance
                variables. Constructors always share the same name as the class. We can overload the name and
                have multiple constructors with different signatures, just as with methods. If no other
                constructor is defined, a default no-argument constructor is implicit, has no arguments, and
                initializes instance values to default values. The default values of instance variables are 0
                for primitive numeric types, false for boolean, and null.
                Instance methods. Instance methods specify the data-type operations. Each instance method has a
                return type, a signature (which specifies its name and the types and names of its parameter
                variables), and a body (which consists of a sequence of statements, including a return statement
                that provides a value of the return type back to the client). When a client invokes a method,
                the parameter values (if any) are initialized with client values, the statements are executed
                until a return value is computed, and the value is returned to the client. Instance methods may
                be public (specified in the API) or private (used to organize the computation and not available
                to clients).
